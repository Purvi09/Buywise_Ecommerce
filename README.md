# Ecommerce Application using Django and Razorpay

## Overview

This is an ecommerce application developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and integrated with Razorpay for payment processing (please note that no real money transactions occur). The application allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to the checkout page for a simulated payment experience using Razorpay.

## Features

- Browse products: Users can view a list of available products with details like name, price, description, and an image representation.

- Add to Cart: Users can add products to their cart to keep track of items they wish to purchase.

- Checkout: Users can proceed to the checkout page where a simulated Razorpay payment process is initiated.

- Razorpay Integration: The application is connected to Razorpay's API to provide a seamless payment experience. Again, it's important to note that no real money is transferred in this demo application.


Usage
Browse Products: On the home page, you will find a list of available products. Click on a product to view its details.

Add to Cart: Click the "Add to Cart" button on the product detail page to add the item to your cart.

View Cart: Access your cart by clicking on the "Cart" link in the navigation bar. Here you can see a summary of your cart items.

Proceed to Checkout: When you are ready to checkout, click the "Proceed to Checkout" button on the cart page. This will initiate the simulated Razorpay payment process.

Payment Simulation: The checkout process will take you to a simulated payment page powered by Razorpay. You can use the test card details provided by Razorpay to complete the payment process.

Order Confirmation: Once the payment simulation is complete, you will be redirected to an order confirmation page.
